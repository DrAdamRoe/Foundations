This app builds on the previous example (living in fullstack/api-ajax-example) to add a SQLite database, replacing the mock data with something more dynamic. 

Install: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run: `python3 app.py`

This should start a server, running by default on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
