Next up is to actually get data from our API and list those restaurants. 
You should already be able to navigate to a new URI in the browser and see something that looks like a list or an array. 
If you haven't already, go to <a href="/api/restaurants/names">/api/restaurants/names</a> in your browser. 
It should display the names of restaurants, in a machine-readable format. This format is called JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. 
</p>

<p>
When you go to this URI, the backend executes a database query using SQL. That data is then read by your Python backend, and the list of restaurants is passed forward via API to the frontend.

<p>
Next, we want to actually get and display our restaurants data. There is a JavaScript function called getAllRestaurantNames() which does exactly this. 
</p>

<p>
Now, try this magical button:
<button onclick="getAllRestaurantNames()">Get Restaurant Names</button>
</p>
